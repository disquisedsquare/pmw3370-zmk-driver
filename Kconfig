      Enables a PixArt PMW3370 driver that talks over SPI. This driver
      is a PMW33xx-family driver scaffold. It currently provides SPI
      probing and a Zephyr sensor API. You will likely need to add a
      SROM upload step (binary SROM file) and tune registers for full
      functionality.
